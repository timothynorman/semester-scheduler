# Semester Scheduler
This program takes the details of a school semester saved as a yaml file, and creates a formatted schedule showing all submissions and tests per week for each course. This allows you to see what's due (or coming due) in a single glance. 

## Future Work
- [ ]  Prompt for input YAML file name/location.
- [ ]  Testing for due date and converting it to week number. Other input sanitization.
- [ ]  Add a GUI
- [ ]  Add ability to modify schedule from the program.
